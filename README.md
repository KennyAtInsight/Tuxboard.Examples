# Tuxboard Examples

Tuxboard is a dashboard library specifically for the ASP.NET Core platform. It was meant to be a Lego-style way to build dashboards.

I'm continually adding more examples through the articles on my [blog](https://www.danylkoweb.com/tuxboard) and using this repository for the "dropzone."

The library is located [here](https://github.com/jdanylko/Tuxboard) and is available through NuGet [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tuxboard.Core).

## Technology Stack
- ASP.NET Core 6.0 or higher (using C#)
- Entity Framework Core

## Examples
The repository contains the following examples:
- **01-SimpleDashboard**<br/>The simplest way to create a static dashboard; VERY basic; no JavaScript with no features ([related post](https://www.danylkoweb.com/Blog/introducing-tuxboard-SY)) <br/><br/>
- **02-WidgetsExample**<br/>A simple dashboard with a simple widget ([related post](https://www.danylkoweb.com/Blog/dashboard-modularity-TD))<br/><br/>
- **03-DragWidgets.Web**<br/>Using TypeScript to move Widgets around on the dashboard<br/><br/>
